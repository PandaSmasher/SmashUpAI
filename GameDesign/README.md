The Python program and the JS do the same things (mostly)
the JS is the one I test with, then I translate to python,
thats why the extra stuff.

The program uses a class for the minions, the actions, and 
the player. A card class didn't seem necessary as there
isn't too much overlap and all can be manipulated within the 
hand and deck arrays. These two are in arrays because making
classes for them seemed unnecessary since the player class can
manipulate these arrays however it wants.
